List of ideas of what to implement:

- Self-signed Server Certificate checked by the clients to authenticate the server.
- Challenge-Response(Nonces) or Timestamps used to prevent replay attacks.
- Client sends a signature of the message to the server, to prove that the message was sent by the client.
