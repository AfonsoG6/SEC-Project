List of ideas of what to implement:
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange for communication between clients and the server.
- Encryption for communication between clients and the server, using the keys resulting from the DH key exchange.
- Server Certificate checked by the clients to authenticate the server.
- Challenge-Response(Nonces) or Timestamps used to prevent replay attacks.
